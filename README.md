# KSR
Code for our SIGIR 2018 paper "Improving Sequential Recommendation with Knowledge-Enhanced Memory Networks". See the paper: https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3209978.3210017

## Setup
This code is based on [GRU4Rec](https://github.com/hidasib/GRU4Rec).

### Requirements
We use the Theano version '0.9.0'. The code was tested with various numpy and pandas versions under python 2.7.12. 

For convenient, you can use virtualenv together with the [requirement](https://github.com/mquad/hgru4rec/blob/master/requirements.txt) to set up a virtual environment before running the code.
